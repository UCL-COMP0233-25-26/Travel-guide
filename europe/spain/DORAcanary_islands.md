# Canary Islands dora
The Canary Islands are an easy win for a quick escape: spring-like weather year-round (usually ~20–26 °C), short flights from the UK, and wildly varied landscapes in one trip. You can hike lunar-looking lava fields in
Lanzarote’s Timanfaya, stargaze by Teide’s volcano peaks, wander Gran Canaria’s Maspalomas dunes, and swim or surf on black- or white-sand 
beaches the same week. Add dolphin and whale watching, superb diving, volcanic wines and fresh seafood, and you’ve got a destination that mixes adventure, relaxation, and good value without long-haul hassle.
