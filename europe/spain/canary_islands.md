# Canary Islands

The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located off the northwest coast of Africa.  
They are known for their volcanic landscapes, pleasant climate, and diverse wildlife.  
I would love to visit to enjoy hiking on volcanic terrain, explore cultural sites, and relax on the beaches.
