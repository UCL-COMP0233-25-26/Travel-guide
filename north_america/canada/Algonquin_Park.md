# Algonquin Park

Algonquin Provincial Park is a provincial park located in Ontario, Canada. The main reason why I want to visit this park is due to its beauty. It is absolutely incredible during all seasons, especially in winter where the amount of snow can reach up unto your waist. Moreover, Algonquin Park was the first place where I saw a Moose in person! All around, it is a great place!
